## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Based on the regression for income wage as the dependent variable it has demonstrated that the education level between some college,college and advanced degree does have a correlation with wage.For instance, someone with a higher education has an occupation has a higher pay. In terms of the regression those that are a certain type of worker is statistically  significantly impacts the data negatively  such that an employer could possibly earn the same as a federal employee unless when taking education level. As we can see those depending on their class of work but have a advanced degree earn 28,095 more than others that do not have a very high level of education as compared to a college which is 23,008. Therefore, we can see a 5,087.37 difference between education of college and education of advanced degree. All of the data is statisitcally significant at all confidence intervals.
